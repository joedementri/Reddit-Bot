# Reddit-Bot
Provide functionality and additional information to select posts occurring daily.

## What this bot is
This bot was created on May 23th, 2018 to assist in the subreddit /r/FortniteBR on reddit. Each day, the in game daily shop is updated, and one user would normally post a picture of the shop. This bot was made to do two three main things: Show every item in the shop (if the image provided by the other user could not), show a picture of each item individually, and keep and provide relevant information requested by a large majority of the userbase.

## Useful Skills
Utilized a variety of techniques such as HTTP Requests, API's, Bash shell/Unix tools, Data Analysis and Management to successfully create the project.

## Exposure
This experiment ran for two months, from May 23 to July 17 2018. During that time, the bot recieved an average of 294 upvotes daily, with a total of 16,479 upvotes, with potentially even more viewing my posts but not upvoting. The highest single day total was 2251 upvotes on May 25 2018, followed by 1899 upvotes on July 5 2018
